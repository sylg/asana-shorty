# Asana Shorty add shortcuts to Asana.com

Asana currently doesn't support shortcurt to view your Inbox or your "My Tasks" list. For a keyboard shortcut heavy app, I think it is a shame.

This chrome extensiom simply add 2 shortcuts to Asana

* Pressing `i` will open your **Inbox** in your current workspace
* Pressing `t` will open your **My Tasks** view in your current workspace

To install the chrome extension, simply go to the [Google Web Store].
